# French Names Database Extractor

A Rust-based tool that creates a comprehensive database of French first names and last names by processing death records from INSEE (French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies).

## Star the project

## Motivation

The tool was created to extract and normalize first names and last names from INSEE death records data. The datas was extracted for creating a dataset with realistic names found in France for machine deep learning.

## Limits

The tool ignores the following cases:

- Names with one character
- Names containing only the same character
- By default it only stores names with more than one occurrence

## Features

- Processes multiple CSV files from INSEE death records
- Extracts and normalizes first names and last names
- Records gender information for first names
- Counts occurrences of each name
- Generates structured JSON output files
- Handles special cases and data cleanup

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or higher
- Cargo package manager

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/french-names-extractor
cd french-names-extractor

# Build the project
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

Command Line Options:  

- -p, --path : Directory containing INSEE CSV files (required)  
- -m, --multiple: true/false : store only occurrences > 1 (default: true)
- -c, --csv: true/false : also create csv files (default: false)
- -h, --help : Show help information  
- -V, --version : Display version information  

## Output Files

The tool generates two JSON files:

firstnames.json

```json
{
  "firstnames": [
    {
      "firstname": "jean",
      "sexe": 1,
      "occurrences": 1822998
    }
  ]
}
```

lastnames.json

```json
{
  "lastnames": [
    {
      "lastname": "dupont",
      "occurrences": 26339
    }
  ]
}
```

## Extracted Data

`firstnames.json`, `lastnames.json`, `firstnames.csv` and `lastnames.csv` in the repository are generated with INSEE death records data from 1970 to september 2024 (inclusive) with the parameter `-c true`.

## Data Source

The death records data is sourced from INSEE's public database: <https://www.insee.fr/fr/information/4769950>
